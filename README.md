# Welcome To ArchDive Virtual

A virtual phone that _throws you in the deep end_, because it literally just archives calls. Want to call your mom?
Nope, can't do that. All you can do is archive the 3 calls you just missed from her!

We were just awarded **$7 million in Series A funding**. Just wait until investors find out that they can also **UNARCHIVE** :rocket:
